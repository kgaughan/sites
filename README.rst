sites
=====

Yet another attempt to get my various sites under control.

The aim is for everything except `Can't Hack`_ and `bethisad.talideon.com`_ to
go here, which have their own repos.

.. _Can't Hack: https://github.com/kgaughan/canthack
.. _bethisad.talideon.com: https://github.com/kgaughan/bethisad.talideon.com

Setup
=====

Ensure pipx is installed, and run:

    uv tool install mkdocs --with mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin

To do
=====

* Deploy komorebi__ on talideon.com properly.
* Deploy stereochro.me: almost a series of redirects at this point.
