# Talideon.com

_talideon.com_ is the online home of [Keith Gaughan](https://stereochro.me/about), a software developer based in Ireland.

I'm currently trying to reconsolidate a whole pile of things that have ended up on different sites. Expect more content over time.

## Elsewhere

I have a weblog called [Can't Hack](https://i.canthack.it/), where I'm attempting to revive my old blogging habit, and maybe improve my writing. I used maintain [Inklings](https://stereochro.me/weblog/), but that devolved into a linklog, and is due to go into semi-retirement as I migrate any longform content from it across.

I'm also on Twitter as [@talideon](https://twitter.com/talideon), and on [Github](https://github.com/kgaughan). I sometimes answer coding questions on [Stack Overflow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keithgaughan), and have the obligatory [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keithgaughan) account.
