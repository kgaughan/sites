<h1>DCOM3 college notes</h1>

<p>This was all written ages back for some friends of mine at college. I
don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll be of much interest to anybody else now, but
there&#8217;s no sense in taking it down.</p>

<p>So you want decent Distributed Systems notes? Well, you&#8217;re in the
right place. Here&#8217;s whatever I&#8217;ve written so far. It&#8217;s all in
PDF format so you&#8217;ll need a copy of Adobe Acrobat to read them. Have
fun!</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/assets/uploads/notes/dcom3/pthreads.pdf">A Short Introduction to POSIX Threads</a> (63kB; 8pp; Last update: 2003-03-03)</li>
<li><a href="/assets/uploads/notes/dcom3/shmem.pdf">Shared Memory and Semaphores</a> (61kB; 11pp; Last update: 2003-03-03)</li>
<li><a href="/assets/uploads/notes/dcom3/curses.pdf">A Short Introduction to Curses</a> (54kB; 6pp; Last update: 2003-02-27)</li>
<li><a href="/assets/uploads/notes/dcom3/sockets.pdf">Client-Server Programming with TCP/IP Sockets</a> (168kB; 21pp; Last update: 2003-03-03)</li>
</ul>

<p>The sockets notes aren&#8217;t completely finished&#8212;the section on
non-blocking sockets and asynchronous I/O still needs to be finished. Except
for that, they&#8217;re pretty darned well done. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll
cover that though until after the exams, at which time I&#8217;ll probably be
rewriting the sockets notes from scratch anyway.</p>

<p>Note: not that it impacts on the usefulness of the notes, but they contain a
lot of in-jokes that you might only get if you&#8217;ve read them all. Still,
if you haven&#8217;t, shame on you!</p>
