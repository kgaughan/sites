sites
=====

Yet another attempt to get my various sites under control.

The aim is for everything except `Can't Hack`_ to go here, which has
`its own repo <https://github.com/kgaughan/canthack>`_.

Layout
======

To keep things sane, all the sites go in `sites/<hostname>`.

I intend on using mkdocs_ for most things, if possible. I recommend installing
it with the pipsi_ wrapper around pip_.

To do
=====

Currently, it only works for domains under talideon.com, and doesn't interact
with any of the ACME_ tooling present, nor is there support for distinct vhost
configurations, though ideally this shouldn't be super necessary.
