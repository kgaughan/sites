Kalaba-X
========

Translating material from your native language into a drastically
different language, or vice versa, requires you to break old habits of
thought and look at ideas in new ways. This exercise can help you to
acquire some of the necessary skills…

An Artificial Language that Teaches the Art of Translation
----------------------------------------------------------

Extracted from a lecture given in 1956 by *Kenneth L. Pike, Ph.D.* first
published in *Bibliotheca Sacra Vol.  114*
{: .source }

In our first lecture we emphasized the fact that a language was a grid,
an emic system by means of which and through which communication takes
place. In the second, we indicated that such a system had, basic to it,
classes of morphemes (or words, or morphemes and words, or words and
phrases) with functional slots into which the classes fitted in sentence
structures. In this, the third lecture, we are not so much interested in
adding new linguistic concepts as we are in exploiting the ones already
set forth.

In order to do this we shall introduce an artificial system which will
serve as the total target language into which passages are to be
translated… The system is fashioned in such a manner as to keep it small
enough to be manageable within the space of a lecture of this kind, but
complete enough to make concrete the manner in which slots and classes
enter into the translation process. Even though the example is built to
order, artificially, the person studying it carefully and experimenting
with it will see in clear perspective some of the most important
elements of translation theory and practice. It is the most effective
method we have been able so far to develop to demonstrate these
principles.

Formulas for an Artificial Training Language
--------------------------------------------

Only one sentence type occurs in this artificial language, a language
which I shall hereafter call Kalaba-X. This sentence type has three
slots which must always be filled, and filled in a particular order:
Each sentence has a predicate slot, followed by an object slot, which in
turn is followed by a subject slot. If we symbolize the obligatory
occurrence by a plus sign (**+**), the formula in so far as it is
implied up to this point would be:

<table class="formula"><tr>
<td><strong>+</strong> Pred.</td>
<td><strong>+</strong> Obj.</td>
<td><strong>+</strong> Subj.</td>
</tr></table>

The fillers of these slots must also be specified, however, before the
formula is usable. That is, both slot and filler of the three gramemes
involved must be known before actual sentences can be constructed in
Kalaba-X.

For the fillers we would save a number of difficulties if we invented
each word and morpheme, and we do this often for certain training
purposes. The unfamiliar morphemes take much longer to recognize,
however, slowing down our present demonstration, and are likely to
change the focus of the reader away from the point we want to
illustrate. In addition, at this stage in training there is very great
gain in the shock received from seeing familiar words used in strange
slots, according to new patterns. It helps the reader assimilate the
implications of the fact, mentioned in the last lecture, that parts of
speech are formal elements, formally resultant from the distribution of
morphemes and words in functional slots, rather than categorical classes
which are universal to all languages. (There is also the possibility
that for many languages the concept of a restricted number of parts of
speech may best be abandoned, to be replaced by a much more flexible
approach to a larger number of criss-crossing groupings.)

This in turn leads to a flexibility of conceptualization in a new
framework which may prevent an inexperienced translator from stalling in
his task when he fails to find the kind of translation equivalents which
he expected. With his imagination trained, he is better able to look for
a correct and adequate but unexpected path out of his dilemma.

To fill the predicate slot we use any English verb. Since only one kind
of predicate grameme is set up, there are no distinctions between
transitive and intransitive verbs. All English verbs, despite their
restrictions in standard English formulas, may occur in this slot. Each
of them, it should be noticed, must be followed by an object. A further
convention is adopted for this stage in the training formula: A verb may
be borrowed from English in any of its inflected forms, according to
convenience; the internal analytical problems raised by these
differences are ignored at this point, left to be covered later by other
phases of the training process.

Both the object slot and the subject slot of Kalaba-X are filled by
English nouns. Here, too, delicate problems arise as to the forms to be
permitted, even though it is specified in advance that any inflected
form of the noun may be used. The formula, then, now looks like this:

<table class="formula"><tr>
<td>Verb</td>
<td>Noun</td>
<td>Noun</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><strong>+</strong> Pred.</td>
<td><strong>+</strong> Obj.</td>
<td><strong>+</strong> Subj.</td>
</tr></table>

One further amplification of the formula is introduced to give more
flexibility to Kalaba-X and to provide an artificial language that is
very simple but which nevertheless allows for the translation into it of
English materials. A modification grameme is added. This grameme, unlike
the others so far described, can come in more than one place. It may
occur, but is not required to be present, after the predicate grameme,
which it then modifies. It may also follow, and modify the object
grameme, or the subject grameme. Although a particular sentence may,
therefore, contain three instances of the modification grameme (one
after each of the basic gramemes), no two modification gramemes come in
sequence, since each of the basic gramemes is restricted to one, and
only one, modifier.

The filler of the modification slot in Kalaba-X may be any English
adjective. Here, as with the other gramemes, some problems arise, since
we are assuming that the list of English adjectives will be clearly
known to the reader, whereas in fact differences of opinion as to the
inclusiveness of the list occur. (In any such particular instance, the
student makes his own arbitrary decision if it does not contradict the
basic rules laid down, and provided that he remains consistent
throughout his work.)

The problem is made much more instructive, however, by a further
extension of the list of fillers appropriate to the modification slot.
Any noun, or any verb, may constitute an acceptable filler of the
modifier slots just as an adjective can do.

Note, then, the revised formula, with the added symbols of slant line
(/) meaning ‘or,’ and parentheses to show the basic gramemes expanded by
a modifier:

+(+P<sup>V</sup> ±M<sup>N/V/A</sup>) + (+O<sup>N</sup> ±M<sup>N/V/A</sup>) + (+S<sup>N</sup> ±M<sup>N/V/A</sup>)
{: .formula }

Note, further, that this formula in part defines a noun for the Kalaba-X
structure: it is a member of that list of words which can fill object,
subject, or modifier slots. A verb is a word which can fill predicate or
modifier slots. An adjective is a word which can fill only a modifier
slot.

From a Complex to a Simple Structure
------------------------------------

We now present a paragraph which is to be translated into Kalaba-X.
Sentences are numbered for convenience of reference:

> \(1) ON A BICYCLE DOWN THE MALL, (2) I was doing my best to make my way
> home from work on my old bicycle and thread my way down St. James, to
> take a short cut through the Park. (3) But I was forced to dismount. (4)
> Picked up by the crowd, I was put down again intact at Marlborough Gate.
> (5) I was going well again when I reached the Mall, and then it dawned
> on me, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were expected. (6) There was
> a traffic diversion. (7) Being a very small fish, I had got through the
> net. (8) The Mall stretched in front of me clear and inviting, with
> police each side keeping the crowd back. (9) “This may never happen
> again,” I said to myself, and without a second thought, kept straight
> on. (10) The good-natured crowd cheered. (11) Even the police had to
> laugh.
>
> — (12) E. T. Sutherland, Torrens Rd., Brixton. *The Evening News*,
> London, July 4, 1953.

Now we suggest a translation into Kalaba-X. Many different-and
presumably better-translations are possible within the limiting
structure. This is not the correct translation. Differences of judgment
as to word equivalences, artistic effects, literalness, and the like,
would prevent any two translators from obtaining identical results, a
principle easily demonstrable in a classroom by this method. Sentences
are numbered to key in to the source paragraph, with a running
commentary on some points which the student should not overlook. One
special caution: the model allows a considerable degree of ambiguity,
since in a sequence of nouns a particular noun might be either subject
or object or might be object or verb modifier, etc. These ambiguities
can only be resolved, if at all, by a study of the context.

\(1) “Rides Mall Bicycle Man.” The title had to be rephrased into a full
sentence, to fit the structure. The predicate “rides” was deduced from
later context, and the noun “Mall” used as a modifier of it, i.e., “to
Mall ride,” as if we were to say “to Boston go.” The prepositions *on*
and *down* disappear; the meaning of “on a bicycle” is carried by the
predicate-object phrase, “ride bicycle.” The articles *a* and *the*
drop-no such word class appears in Kalaba-X; the distinction of the
English definiteness or indefiniteness would be made explicit in
Kalaba-X only if it were important to the context. Categories obligatory
to a source language must often be dropped in this fashion, lest a
translation made to preserve them become exceedingly long and
cumbersome.

(2a) “Owned bicycle old speaker present.” Since no pronouns occur in
Kalaba-X (one of the bits where it is least like a natural language,
where “I” would presumably be found), a substitute technique must be
used to signal the reader that this is a firsthand account. Note here
the subject “speaker present”; and compare sentence 12, which makes the
signal less ambiguous. Similarly, “my” drops, and the possession
requires statement in new form-here, in a verb with its object.

(2b) “Left work speaker.” We were unable to begin with “doing my best”
since it has no nominal object, and since the whole concept of the first
source sentence was too complicated for a single sentence in Kalaba-X.
In order to simplify it, we pulled out the phrases “my old bicycle” and
“from work” and made separate sentences of each, to get the setting
ready for the main action.

(2c) “Attempted difficulty trip homeward speaker.” Now the idiom “was
doing my best” is reworked into a predicate “Attempted” plus a noun
“difficulty” modifying it, i.e., “attempted with difficulty.”

(2d) “Traversed street St.-James’s speaker.” The change from a complex
structure to a simple one often involves repetition of some parts. Here
the subject has been repeated, since no pronoun is available, nor can
“and” be used to connect the predicates of (2c) and (2d). The compound
street name “St.-James’s” is treated as a unit-under the assumption that
speakers of Kalaba-X mimic the total pronunciation without recognition
of its grammatical structure. The lexical change from “threaded” to
“traversed” deletes a figure of speech which, to be intelligible, might
have needed an expansion which hardly seemed warranted-the progress of
the story was not tied in to this figure of speech of needle and thread
(but see the “fish” figure in 7).

(2e) “Comprised shortcut Park intention speaker.” The source purpose
seen in “to” is transferred to a subject noun “intention,” with the old
subject “I” buried in “speaker” which functions in (2c) as modifier. The
prepositional phrase “through the Park” is handled by “Park” as modifier
of the object.

\(3) “Forced descent bicycle circumstances.” A pseudoactor,
“circumstances,” is added; perhaps “crowd” would have been better. The
passive complex verb is replaced by the active one, and “to dismount”
becomes the object “descent” (from the bicycle). Perhaps “Dismounted
speaker crowd” would have been a better translation.

(4a) “Lifted speaker crowd.” The two-word phrase “picked up” is replaced
by a single word for the Kalaba-X format.

(4b) “Released Marlborough-Gate speaker intact crowd.” As an alternate:
“Constituted site release Marlborough-Gate,” if “intact” is handled
otherwise.

(5a) “Continued succeeded point Mall journey resume. The verbs
“succeeded” and “resume” are modifiers of predicate and object, i.e.,
“The resumed journey successfully continued to the Mall spot.” The verb
“resume” covers the source word “again.”

(5b) “Clarified suddenness understanding speaker situation surprise.”
Three noun modifiers—suddenness,” “surprise,” and “speaker—fill modifier
spots.

(5c) “Wait appearance Queen crowd expect.” The object is “appearance,”
with “Queen” as modifier.

(5d) “Wait Duke Edinburgh crowd.” Repetitiveness is avoided in 5c-d by
using “appearance” as explicit object only in 5c, with “Duke” as object
in 5d.

\(6) “Rerouted previous traffic officials.” English pseudo-subject
“there” must be replaced, and “officials” (or “police”) obtained from
context. “Previous” modifies “rerouted,” not “traffic.”

(7a) “Constituted analogy fish small speaker.”

(7b) “Penetrated fish net traffic speaker unimpeded.” The fish analogy
is preserved, at a cost of spelling it out in detail. In 7b, “fish”
modifies “penetrated,” i.e., “to penetrate like a fish.” It could have
been dropped, to yield (replacing 7a-7b) something like “Penetrated
restraints traffic speaker unimportant,” or “Penetrated restraints
traffic vehicle small.”

(8a) “Appears front space open Mall extends.” The word “extends” is
merely a verb modifying “Mall,” i.e., “the extended Mall…”; it is not a
predicate in a new formula.

(8b) “Invites ride Mall.”

(8c) “Restrain sides crowd lines police.” The noun “sides” modifies
“restrain,” deduced from context.

(9a) “Tells speaker speaker.” Alternate: “Soliloquized words following
speaker,” which perhaps more clearly states that a quotation is to
follow.

(9b) “Represents probability negative opportunity repeat.”

(9c) “Gives negative consideration more rider storyteller.”

(9d) “Proceeds direction straight rider.”

\(10) “Cheered rider crowd pleasant.”

\(11) “Restrain failure laughter own police.”

\(12) “Tells story own E. -T. -Sutherland.”

\(13) “Inhabits Torrens-Rd. Brixton storyteller.”

\(14) “Published London story The-Evening-News.”

\(15) “Happened Four July story 1953.”

This last set (13-15) is awkward. “Brixton” is assumed to modify the
name of the street. “London” modifies “published.” “1953” is treated as
a unit modifying “story,” and “July” as modifying “four.”

In summary, various changes may occur when one translates from a complex
to a simple structure. Among those illustrated in the above problem are
addition of fillers to slots obligatory to the target language but not
to the source language; partial loss of some categorical distinctions
obligatory to the source language; loss of parts of speech or of
morpheme classes present in the source language but absent in the target
language; loss of constructions based on these classes; transference of
load from lost components to target components, such as when a lexical
item-say a particular noun-in the target language carries the functional
meaning of a special particle in the source language; change of order of
words or slots; shortening of complex sentences into multiple short
target sentences; dropping figures of speech or else making them more
explicit; replacing idioms with lexical or structural substitutes;
drawing on context for interpretive data to fill blanks required by
formal structure; the more sequence of the sentences may be forced to
carry implications of time, sequence, or cause, or dependence, or
relatedness, etc., which were in the complex structure signaled by
particles of some type.

Artistic Use of Simple Structures
---------------------------------

A person unacquainted with language forms might conclude that a language
with a simple structure would lead to a dreary style. This is far from
true. Every structure, in the hands of an artist, lends itself to
beautiful effects. A simple structure may lead to balanced lines and
artistic repetition. An occasional Chinese verse might seem to the
uninitiated layman to be built on a model scarcely more complex than the
sentence type we have been studying.

Perhaps the reader would enjoy seeing verse in the format given. The
following verse utilizes that pattern, with a few changes; one further
sentence type, limited to a single exclamatory word, is added, and some
hyphenated two-morpheme items are treated as single slot-filling units:

<blockquote style="white-space:pre">
Enters bird big, man bewildered.
Maketh sound loud, bird silvered.
  Whoosh!
Aimeth sky top, bird up-flying
Falleth ground face, earth low-lying.
  Wow!
Hideth earth low, clouds heavy.
Rocketh gentle man, bird steady.
  Nice!
Cover eyes blue, eyelids drooping.
Covers sky blue, darkness stooping,
  Sleep!
Open eyes tired, man wondering.
Breaketh air night, storm thundering.
  Boom!
Rocketh bird poor, storm no-cease.
Reacheth land firm, bird one-piece.
  Whew!
    —<em>Dorothy Barnhouse</em>
</blockquote>

For verse with no changes other than a comma to make unambiguous by a
pause the end of the object, note the following:

<blockquote style="white-space:pre">
Owns lamb little, Mary.
Loves lamb, Mary little.
Loves Mary pretty, lamb.
Owns lamb, Mary pretty.
Seems snow, fleece white.
Equals snow white, fleece.
Equals snow, fleece soft.
Seems fleece soft, snow.
</blockquote>

First-Stage Translation into a Complex Structure
------------------------------------------------

Translation from a simple structure to a complex one may entail all of
the problems faced in translating English to Kalaba-X, but in reverse.
Instead of fewer parts of speech, or distribution classes, there may be
more; several simple sentences may need to be combined into a large
complex one; the number and function of obligatory slots may be
different; and so on. In our next illustration we shall translate from
Kalaba-X into English. Instead of emphasizing these same problems,
however, we shall use the illustration to demonstrate two other points:
(1) A sentence-by-sentence translation can be made, meeting all, or
almost all, of the requirements already discussed for adequate
translation from structure to structure, but still be awkward,
unpleasant, and completely unsatisfactory even though accurate. (2)
Satisfactory translation must take account of units larger than the
sentence; it must consider the story, or quotation, or paragraph, or
document as a whole; it must approximate a choice of vocabulary, choice
of sentence type, and choice of general style of exposition which will
be appropriate to the age, sex, training, experience, cultural setting,
and purpose of comparable speakers or writers in the target culture; it
must, in sum, have the flavor of an original document in the target
culture.

In order to show these points we will first present a short incident
recorded in our artificial language Kalaba-X. Interlined with it we will
give a first-stage translation, one sentence at a time, into the target
language, which is normal English. Later we will give a second-stage
translation of the incident as a whole, modified for better style.

\(1) “Made resolutions New-Year writer.”

(Trans.: “The writer made some New Year’s resolutions.”)

\(2) “Constitutes writer speaker.

(Trans.: “The speaker is the writer.”

\(3) “Contained resolution following list.”

(Trans.: “The list contained the following resolution.”)

\(4) “Necessitate patience increase reactions writer.”

(Trans.: “The writer’s reactions need increased patience.”)

\(5) “Apply need direction daughter patience require.”

(Trans.: “The required patience must be applied in the daughter’s
direction.”)

\(6) “Constitutes daughter Janet.”

(Trans.: “Janet is the daughter.”)

\(7) “Belongs writer daughter.”

(Trans.: “The daughter belongs to the writer.”)

\(8) “Disregard obligation irritation degreeless writer.”

(Trans.: “The writer has an obligation to disregard irritation of any
degree.”)

\(9) “Necessitates remembrance facts reaction writer.”

(Trans.: “The writer’s reaction makes necessary the recollection of
certain facts.”)

\(10) “Attained exclusive years fifteen Janet.”

(Trans.: “Janet is just fifteen years old.”)

\(11) “Constitutes currently adolescent Janet.”

(Trans.: “Janet is now an adolescent.”)

\(12) “Exasperates adults adolescence.”

(Trans.: “Adolescence exasperates adults.”)

\(13) “Discovered accident resolutions different writer.”

(Trans.: “The writer accidentally discovered some different
resolutions.”)

\(14) “Requests imagination reader writer.”

(Trans.: “The writer requests imagination to be used by the reader.”)

\(15) “Affected feelings writer discovery.”

(Trans.: “The discovery affected the writer ts feelings.”)

\(16) “Belong Janet resolution New year’s.”

(Trans.: “The New Year’s resolutions belonged to Janet.”)

\(17) “Saw resolution first writer.”

(Trans.: “The writer saw the first resolution.”)

\(18) “Stated words following resolution.”

(Trans.: “The resolution read as follows.”

\(19) “Requires effort increased situation.”

(Trans.: “The situation requires increased effort.”)

\(20) “Obligated patience mother daughter.”

(Trans.: “A daughter is obligated to have patience toward her mother.”)

If now we read rapidly the interlinear translation, it becomes clear
that it does not yet remotely reach our ultimate goal of an accurate
translation which sounds like a document originally written in English.

Second-Stage Translation into a Complex Structure
-------------------------------------------------

A second-stage translation is needed in which the style should be made
more normal. Before attempting this we should note the over-all setting,
and deduce something of the character of the writers so as to get a clue
to the kinds of styles people of a comparable type would use in English.
The author is a woman sophisticated enough to keep a diary, old
enough-and young enough-to have a fifteen-year-old daughter, alert,
resilient, able to recognize and appreciate a subtle joke on herself,
and sufficiently articulate to write up the incident to share the
pleasure with others. The daughter is adolescent, but sophisticated in
sensing that responsibilities must be shared.

Since Kalaba-X and English differ so greatly, there is a corresponding
great difference in possible translations from the one to the other. The
following attempt is only one of many possible translations:

(l-3) “I made some New Year’s resolutions, with this one among them.”
Note that the sentences are combined, the incident told in the first
person, the more informal “this one” replacing “the following.”

(5-7) “I must be more patient with my daughter Janet.” The phrase “my
daughter Janet” covers 6-7, while 5 is made more idiomatic and informal.

(8-12) “Regardless of the degree to which she becomes irritating, my
reaction to her must keep in mind the fact that she is just fifteen, a
mere adolescent, and that this age is always exasperating to other
people.”

(13-18) “But just imagine how I felt when by accident I ran across
Janet’s New Year’s resolutions and saw that the first one read:

(19-20) “A daughter should be patient with her mother; I must try harder
with mine.”

Many problems can be demonstrated by these techniques, which time does
not allow in this lecture. Once the student has learned to adapt his
final draft to a desired style it may be necessary to give some
illustrations of instances in which the translator has taken too great
liberty with the text, in adding speculative material not justified by
the context, or by changing content as such rather than the formal
matters of the structural grid.

One of the best exercises to teach balance in this regard is to have one
group of students translate from English into Kalaba-X, and a second
group of students translate back into English without having seen the
original. When the two English versions diverge sharply on nonformal
matters, or in emotional over-tones, or in style, the two translations
should be checked to see if one or the other was inadequate, or whether
the cultural setting was too obscure to give the style clues needed.

In line with this suggestion, we now give the original from which the
Kalaba-X story about Janet was taken. The reader may wish to modify one
of the translations in accordance with these principles:

> On my list of New Year’s resolutions was: “Be more patient with my
> daughter Janet. No matter how irritating she is, remember that, after
> all, she is only 15, and is going through the exasperating period of
> adolescence.” Imagine then my feeling when, quite by accident, I came
> across Janet’s New Year’s resolutions and saw at the head of her list:
> “Try and be more patient with Mother.” *Contributed by Mrs. C. R.
> Knowles, *The Reader’s Digest*, Jan. 1952, p. 79.*
