July 31st, 2013: Currently, the description of Breathanach isn’t
published anywhere, so I grabbed
[a cached version from the Internet Archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20100110124000/http://www.cix.co.uk/~morven/lang/breath.html).

I hope Geoff Eddy doesn’t mind me taking liberties like this, but I
think the language is worth preserving.

About Breathanach
-----------------

Breathanach is the ‘Q’ to Brithenig’s ‘P’ - an attempt to discover what
might have happened if Latin had displaced primitive Irish in Ireland
(and later, of course, Scotland). In other words, it’s a Romance
language which looks and sounds rather like Gaelic. If you haven’t yet
seen Brithenig, I strongly recommend
[you take a look](http://hobbit.griffler.co.nz/introduction.html). Breathanach
is part of [Ill Bethisad](http://polaris.umuc.edu/~pbrown/brithenig/),
where there are several other interesting conlangs to discover.

Many words in Breathanach come from a form of Latin closer to Classical
Latin rather than to Vulgar Latin, for example the word for “white” is
**albh** from the Latin **albus**, rather than something like **\*blag**
which is cognate with modern-day Romance. (This is another way of saying
that it’s easier for me to work out Breathanach words by looking in my
Latin dictionary than by consulting four separate dictionaries for
French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese. It also allows Breathanach to
have a phonology closer to that of the Gaelic it is supposed to
resemble.)

Like modern Welsh, Breathanach is used in two distinct registers: the
normal everyday spoken language (**liong fholgáir** “common tongue”,
henceforth abbreviated to LF), and the more formal elevated language of
public speeches and religious ceremonies (**liong nóibhil** “noble
tongue”, abbreviated to LN). LF is characterised by the loss of many
grammatical endings and their replacement by more analytical
constructions, while LN is terser and more synthetic. The following
description covers both registers, since the learner is likely to
encounter both. LN words are preferred in the text; LF equivalents,
where different, are given in \[square brackets\]

The variety of Breathanach presented here is the de facto standard,
which is a hybrid of the two main dialect groupings. The main division
in Breathanach dialects is between the more conservative dialects of
Ibhirn to the west of the North Channel and the more innovative dialects
to the east, in Caileadhóin. The most salient differences in
pronunciation and spelling between the dialects are mentioned where
appropriate. Here’s a highly provisional [map](caileadhoin.png) showing
the parts of Caileadhóin where Breathanach is spoken; it’s about 1200
pixels square.

Q-Celtic speakers may, rightly, protest at some unintentional and
improbable resemblances to
[Proto-Liotan](http://web.archive.org/web/20100110124000/http://www.cix.co.uk/~morven/lang/l_proto.html);
the two languages should have nothing in common except their
Q-Celticity, but some crossover is, I suppose, inevitable.

Sounds and Spelling {#ssp}
-------------------

Breathanach has 52 distinct phonemes (contrastive sounds), and as such
is not an easy language for non-natives to pronounce. Eighteen letters -
those of the Roman alphabet minus JKQVWXYZ - are used to transcribe
them.

### Stress {#s-stress}

The primary stress on Breathanach words is on the first syllable,
discounting any prefixes. The stress is strong enough to cause two
effects: vowel reduction and syncope. Vowel reduction is dealt with
under [vowels](#s-vow). In some western dialects of Ibhirn, the stress
shifts to a non-initial syllable with a long vowel if the vowels in all
the preceding syllables are short; thus these dialects normally stress
**moinéir** on the second syllable.

Syncope is the loss of a medial syllable containing a short unstressed
vowel when an additional syllable is added to a word of two or more
syllables; it is much more common in LF than in LN. The first example in
this file is the adjective **féilisc** “happy”; its plural would
normally be **féilisce**, but the second syllable was pronounced so
weakly that it eventually dropped out, leaving behind **féilsce**. If
consonants of opposite qualities combine as a result of syncope, the
quality of the resulting group is dictated by the final consonant; thus
**castain** “chestnut” becomes **caistne** in the feminine plural from
**castaine**.

### Consonants {#s-cons}

The basic Breathanach consonants are P T C; B D G; F S M; N L R. Each of
these can be either **broad** and **slender**: broad consonants, which
correspond more or less to the English ones, are those written next to
the letters A O U; slender (palatised) consonants, which in most may be
approximated with a following Y-sound, are those next to E I. The rule
is commonly expressed as **láth a láth e striocht a striocht**, i.e.
“broad to broad and slender to slender”

The approximate pronunciations of the basic consonants are given by the
letter in uppercase in the words shown below.

         Broad     Slender
  ------ --------- ----------
  P      Pat       Pure
  B      Bat       Beauty
  T      Tap       Tune (1)
  D      Dot       Dune (2)
  C      Cat       Cure
  G      Got       arGue
  F      Fat       Few
  L(L)   aLL (3)   Let (3)
  S      Sat       Sheet
  N(N)   oN        Net (4)
  M      Mat       Mew
  R(R)   aRe       Real (4)

Note the following:

1.  British pronunciation, like T + Y. In Caileadhóin, often like CH in
    English “CHin”.
2.  Ditto (i.e. D + Y). In Caileadhóin, often like J in English “Jet”.
3.  the “dark” and “clear” sounds of English respectively.
4.  no convenient English examples. NN when slender is sometimes
    pronounced like NG in “sing” in Ibhirn, particuarly in the
    south-west.

In a cluster, the consonants are either all broad or all slender. N
before C G is pronounced NG as in English “bank”.

Certain clusters are spelled differently in Caileadhóin: SB SD SG are
found for SP ST SC, while CHT becomes CHD and is pronounced CHC.

### Mutations {#s-mut}

**Mutations** are the processes by which some consonant sounds change
into others; as with Brithenig, they are very important in Breathanach,
although the actual sound-changes are different. Mutations frequently
occur at the beginning of a word in certain situations, especially when
triggered by a preceding word which ends or used to end in a vowel. As a
simple example, in **eall phaoll** “the girl”, the initial P of
**paoll** is mutated by the preceding **eall**.

The most common mutation is **lenition**, which can occur anywhere in a
word. In all consonants except L N R, lenition is indicated by a
following H; L N R are actually the lenited forms, the unlenited forms
being written LL NN RR (except at the beginning of a word, when you just
have to know). The approximate sounds of the lenited consonants are
indicated below.

  ---- --------- ------------
       Broad     Slender
  PH   Fat       Few
  BH   Vat (3)   View
  TH   Hat       Hat (1)
  DH   (4)       Yet
  CH   aCH (2)   iCH (2)
  GH   (4)       Yet
  FH   silent    silent
  L    (6)       Lure (9)
  SH   Hat       Hew
  N    (7)       oNion (10)
  MH   (5)       (5)
  R    (8)       (8)
  ---- --------- ------------

Again, note the following:

1.  TH has no broad-slender distinction. It is silent in Caileadhóin.
2.  German pronunciation
3.  often like Water, Wood
4.  as in Dutch zeGGen; a kind of gargle
5.  as BH, but with noticeable nasalisation
6.  very “dark” L sound, darker than aLL
7.  very “dark” N sound, darker than oN
8.  trilled versions of unlenited sounds
9.  British pronunciation; effectively L + Y
10. effectively N + Y.

In LF, BH DH GH are often silent at the ends of words, and slender TH in
the second person plural of verbs is often pronounced like slender CH.

Lenition appears in numerous situations right through the language; most
usually it is caused by the lenited consonant having been between two
vowels.

Another mutation is eclipsis (also known as nasalisation), which only
occurs at the beginnings of words. By eclipsis, P T C F become B D G BH
and are writted BP DT GC BHF; similarly, B D G become M N NG and are
writted MB ND NG. Eclipsis prefixes N- to vowels; one instance of its
occurrence is after the article “a, an, one”, as in **u-gcain** “a dog,
one dog”. It is much less common than lenition; it occurs after some
words which originally ended in a nasal consonant.

Nasalisation does not operate in many Caileadhóin dialects. Instead, the
nasal is assimilated to the following consonant so that before P B F it
becomes M and before C G it is pronounced ”ng”; thus **un cain** “a
dog”, **um páin** “a loaf of bread”.

The third mutation is non-mutation, in which H- is prefixed to an
initial vowel which does not undergo mutation in an environment where
mutation might occur, such as in **eall h-acla** “the eagles”, by
contrast with **eall acal** “the eagle”. Non-mutation is the rarest of
the three mutations; it is often due to an original word-final S.

Words which lenite are written “-h” after them. Words which nasalise are
similarly indicated with following “-n”, and non-mutation is signalled
by “-\*”. Words undergoing non-mutation which begin with a consonant are
written here with “\*” before the consonant to show when non-mutation is
taking place. (Or should that be “not taking place”? Suggestions
welcome.)

The clusters SP ST SC never undergo any mutation.

### Vowels {#s-vow}

Unlike other Romance languages, the vowels in Breathanach may be long or
short; the difference between long and short vowels is often
significant, serving to differentiate pairs of words; for example
**cas** “house”, **cás** “box”. There are six short vowels, five long
vowels and two diphthongs.

The long vowels are transcribed with the acute accent, viz. Á É Í Ó Ú;
note that Caileadhóin uses grave accents, i.e. À È Ì Ò Ù. Their
qualities are respectively like the vowels in English “far”, “say”,
“see”, “so” and “sue”, but pure - i.e. as a Scot would say them. Before
broad consonants, É and Ó are opener, more like the vowels in “set” and
“saw”. In stressed syllables they are pronounced about twice as long as
short vowels; in unstressed syllables long vowels are shortened, but
keep their quality.

The short vowels are transcribed A E I O U, and have the same qualities
as the corresponding long vowels. In unstressed syllables all short
vowels are reduced to a “schwa” - the indistinct vowel sound in the
second syllables of “village” or “butter”. Before a slender consonant,
the schwa is more like the vowel in “it”.

The diphthongs, which are not found in unstressed syllables, are IA and
UA, which are combinations of short I U followed by a schwa.

The only short vowel which appears at the ends of words of more than one
syllable is schwa, which is written A or E according as the preceding
consonant is broad or slender. A schwa is inserted in speech (but not
spelling) in combinations of L N R and B BH C CH G GH P PH F M MH when
preceded by a short stressed vowel; thus **parbh** “small” is pronounced
as though it is written **parabh**.

Extra “glide” vowels are used in writing to indicate the qualities of
neighbouring consonants. In all cases, E I (slender vowels) are written
next to slender consonants, while A O U (broad vowels) are written next
to broad consonants. This means in practice that there are up to four
ways of spelling each vowel sound, using up to three letters;
consequently, what may appear to be a diphthong is probably a single
vowel sound between consonants of different qualities.

Genrally speaking, if no vowel in a group is accented, the last vowel is
probably a glide, except if the group is or begins with AO EO IU. The
spellings of the short vowel sounds in stressed syllables are as
follows, where B and S represent broad and slender consonants
respectively.

        A     E     I     O     U     IA        UA    schwa
  ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- ----- --------- ----- -------
  B-B   A     AO    (1)   O     U     (4)       UA    A
  B-S   AI    (2)   AOI   OI    UI    (4)       UAI   AI
  S-B   (3)   EA    IO    EO    IU    IA        (5)   EA
  S-S   EAI   EI    I     EOI   IUI   IAI (6)   (5)   I

Notes:

1.  I becomes E between two broad consonants.
2.  E becomes I between a broad and a slender consonant.
3.  A becomes E between a slender and a broad consonant.
4.  IA is only found after slender consonants.
5.  UA is only found after broad consonants.
6.  The theoretical spelling IAI is very rare; IA normally becomes ÉI
    before a slender consonant.

Long vowels are much simpler - the extra vowel letters are still
written, but the vowel which is to be sounded always bears an accent.

Caileadhóin idiosyncratically uses the spelling EU for long E before a
broad vowel (normally ÉA), and pronounces the vowels transcribed AO(I)
further back in the mouth.

In LF, vowels before LL NN RR are often diphthongised; thus **mann**
“big” and **ceall** “that” sound a bit like \[maun\] and \[k’eul\].

Grammar {#gram}

### Nouns {#g-nouns}

Nouns in Breathanach may be either masculine or feminine, singular or
plural, and in LN can appear in one of five cases. The cases are the
nominative, accusative, genitive, dative and vocative of Latin; the
original ablative had fallen in with the dative. The forms of the cases
are various, depending on whether the noun ends in a broad or slender
consonant or a vowel.

Here are the full declensions of the masculine nouns **fior** “man”,
**gleidh** “sword”, and **cain** “dog”:

Singular

**fidh** “faith”:

paoill(eabh)

geil(eabh)

fidh(eabh)

Voc

paoille

fidhe

The genitive and dative plural endings shown in brackets are nowadays
very rarely found.

The cases are thus used more or less as follows:

-   Nominative: as the subject of the verb.
-   Accusative: as the direct object of the verb, or after certain
    prepositions.
-   Genitive: when one noun depends on another in some way.
-   Dative: as the indirect object of the verb, or after certain other
    prepositions.
-   Vocative: when the noun is addressed directly,

Thus, in **ill fior fidhith eall chas eall phaolla**, “the man sees the
girl’s house”, **ill fior** is in the nominative case, **eall chas** is
in the accusative, and **eall phaolla** is in the genitive. In **fire!
da ill gleidh all phaolla!** “man! give the sword to the girl!”,
**fire** and **phaolla** are in the vocative and dative cases
respectively.

In LF the case distinctions are no longer observed, with only the
nominative forms surviving. The only ending still in use for masculine
nouns is thus the plural **-e**, with the final consonant becoming
slender if it is broad in the singular. For feminine nouns, **-a** is
added in the plural if the final consonant is broad and **-e** if it is
slender.

Thus, in LF “man” is always **fior** in the singular and **fire** in the
plural - note how the spelling of the vowel I changes to indicate the
change in quality of the R. Similarly, the nouns “sword”, “girl” and
“helmet” are **gleidh, paoll, geil** in the singular and **gleidhe,
paolla, gaele** in the plural. The sentence “the man sees the girl’s
house” in LF is thus **ill fior fidh la chas dealla phaoll**. \[Note
that “sword” is more usually **glíth** in LF.\]

#### Peculiar plurals

As in Brithenig, some masculine nouns have feminine singular forms for
their plurals; thus, for example, **ill corn** “the horn”, plural **eall
chorn**.

Some nouns change vowels in the plural; thus **óbh** “egg”, plural
**uabh** \[but both are **úth** in LF\]. Note that **-ao-** (sounded E)
becomes **-aoi-** (sounded I): **caos** “cheese”, plural **caois**.

#### Articles and demonstratives

Nouns in Breathanach very frequently appear accompanied by the important
words corresponding to English “the” (definite article), “a”, “an” and
“some” (indefinite article), and “this” and “that” (demonstrative
adjectives). These words are shown below; note the mutations of initial
consonants: lenition after the feminine singular of both articles,
non-mutation after the feminine plural of both articles, nasalisation
after the masculine singular indefinite article, and lenition after all
demonstratives. The last two lines are the demonstrative pronouns
(“this”, “that”, “this one” and so on).

Note that the words for “some” are formed with **de** “of, from”.

### Adjectives and adverbs {#g-adjs}

Adjectives almost always follow the nouns they modify and, like nouns,
decline in five cases in LN. They also inflect for gender and number
similar to nouns, as shown below. The adjective is **parbh** “small”.

Singular

nom

fior parbh

paoll pharbh

acc

fior bparbh

paoll bparbh

gen

fire phairbh

paolla pharbha

dat

fiora parbh

paolla pharbha

voc

fire pharbh

paoll pharbh

nom

fire phairbhe

paolla pharbha

acc

fiora \*parbh

paolla \*parbh

gen

fior bparbh(ra)

paoll bparbh(ra)

dat

fior pairbh(eabh)

paoill phairbh(eabh)

voc

fir phairbh

paoille phharbh

As with nouns, only the nominatives of adjectives are used in LF. Thus
it only needs to be remembered that adjectives after feminine and plural
nouns lenite the initial consonant, and plurals of adjectives follow the
same rules as nouns. Thus the four LF forms of **parbh** and the slender
adjective **féilisc** “happy” are as follows:

  -------------------- ---------------- ----------------
  Masculine singular   fior parbh       fior féilisc
  Masculine plural     fire phairbhe    fire fhéilsce
  Feminine singular    paoll pharbh     paoll fhéilisc
  Feminine plural      paolla pharbha   paolla fhéilsc
  -------------------- ---------------- ----------------

Note the syncope in the plural of **féilisc**.

In LN, the vowels change in feminine singular forms of many adjectives;
for example the feminine singulars of **sól** ”alone” and **dúr** “hard”
are **sual** and **dór**. Such changes are rare in LF, in which the
masculine forms are used for the feminine.

Adjectives inflect whether they are used attributively (i.e. directly
with a noun) or predicatively (i.e. with a verb in between): **la phaoll
pharbh** “the small girl”, **la paolla sunn parbha** “the girls are
small”. Note however that predicative adjectives do not mutate their
initial letters.

Some adjectives may precede the noun to indicate a figurative, rather
than a literal, meaning; in such instances the first letter of the noun
is lenited. The stock example is **póiphir** “poor”: note the difference
between the literal **fior póiphir** “man with no money” and the
figurative **póiphir fhior** “pitiable man”.

Adjectives may be freely used as nouns: **ille póiphre** “the poor
people”, **ille feithle** “the old ones”. In more archaic LN, **-n** was
suffixed to the adjective as with demonstrative pronouns: **ille
póiphrine**, **ille feithline**.

#### Comparitives

The comparitive forms of adjectives are made with **maith-\*** “more”
and **mion-\*** “less”, with **ca** before the noun being compared to:
**maith \*grand ca un chas** “bigger than a house”, with **grand** “big”
and **cas** “house”. The superlative case is formed in the same way as
in Brithenig (and modern French), thus “the biggest house” is **eall
chas eall mhaith \*grand**.

In LN, the comparitive and superlative of most adjectives may be formed
with the suffixes **-ear** and **-seamh**, as with **foirtear**
“stronger” and **foirtseamh** “strongest” (usually written
**foirseamh**, since T is often lost before the S), but these forms are
usually regarded as archaic. The suffixes cause the last letter of the
adjective to become slender; thus **alt** “tall” has the archaic
comparitives **ailtear** and **ail(t)seamh**.

Four common adjectives have irregular comparitives and superlatives:

  Positive        Comparitive   Superlative
  --------------- ------------- -------------
  bon “good”      meilear       oichteamh
  mal “bad”       píor          peiseamh
  mann “great”    méar          maisceamh
  parbh “small”   meanar        mineamh

**Mann** and **grand** both mean the same thing and may be used
interchangeably. A corresponding alternative to **parbh** is **póch**.

#### Adverbs

Adverbs are formed by suffixing **-mhinn** to the feminine form of the
adjective: **fort-mhinn** “strongly”, **leann-mhinn** “slowly”; and they
always follow the verb: **canta leann-mhinn** “I sing slowly”. The
initial letter of the adverb is often lenited after a verb, but this is
considered vulgar and is not recommended.

### Prepositions {#g-preps}

Prepositions are used to indicate relations between nouns. A few common
prepositions combine with a following definite or indefinite article,
for example:

             a “to”    de “from”   in “in”     so “on”    por “for”
  ---------- --------- ----------- ----------- ---------- -----------
  ill        aill      dill        nill        soill      poill
  eall-h     alla-h    deall-h     neall-h     soll-h     polla-h
  ille       aille     dille       nille       soille     poille
  ealla-\*   alla-\*   dealla-\*   nealla-\*   solla-\*   polla-\*
  u-n        a-n       de-n        i-n         so-n       por u-n
  un-h       an-h      dean-h      in-h        son-h      por un-h

**De** replaces the genitive case in LF: **la chas dill fior** “the
man’s house, the house of the man” (formal **cas fire**). As mentioned
above, **de** is also used to express “some”, thus **dill páin** means
both “some bread” and “of the bread”.

### Pronouns {#g-prons}

The pronouns retain three of the noun cases: the nominative, accusative
and genitive. They are as shown below.

The vowels of **me**, **te** and **tu** are usually short in normal
conversation, but are lengthened when the pronoun is being emphasised.

The third person pronouns are used when referring to things
(corresponding to “it”) as well as people; **is** refers to a masculine
noun and **sa** to a feminine noun. **Saoi** is used only when referring
to groups of entirely feminine nouns; **ise** is used in all other
cases. The same, of course, applies to the corresponding object
(accusative) pronouns.

The third person genitive pronouns depend on the gender and number of
the noun possessed, not the possessor: **sua chain** “his/her/their
dog”, **sa gheil** “his/her/their helmet”, **saoi ghleidhe**
“his/her/their swords”.

Of the second person pronouns, **fua** is also used in the singular,
except when speaking to a person with whom the speaker is familiar or
intimate; in such situations **tu** is used instead.

The object pronouns always precede the verb: **geo te fhidhe** “I see
you”. The special third person reflexive pronoun is **sia-h**, which
corresponds more or less to “himself”, “herself”, “oneself”, “itself”
and “themselves”: **eall cain sia labh** “the dog washes itself”.

The possessive pronouns “mine”, “yours” and so on are formed with the
genitive of the pronoun and **un** “one”:

  person   English       masc sing   fem sing   masc plur   fem plur
  -------- ------------- ----------- ---------- ----------- -----------
  1 sing   “mine”        mean        mean       meine       meana
  2 sing   “thine”       tean        tean       teine       teana
  3 sing   “his, hers”   sean        sean       seine       seana
  1 plur   “ours”        noistean    noistean   noistine    noisteana
  2 plur   “yours”       foistean    foistean   foistine    foisteana
  3 plur   “theirs”      sean        sean       seine       seana

All of these are preceded by the appropriate article: **eall mhean**
“mine (fem sing)”, etc.

#### Indefinite pronouns and adjectives

The principal indefinite pronouns and the corresponding adjectives are
the following:

adjective

some, any

aileach

someone, anyone

alchan

all

tóth

everyone

tóthan

each

caosc

each one

caoscan

no

null

### Verbs {#g-verbs}

Breathanach verbs are comparable in complexity with those of other
Romance languages, more so in LN than in LF. As with Latin, they are
traditionally divided into four conjugations; in practice, however, the
differences between the conjugations are small. Each conjugation is
characterised by a **thematic vowel**, which - as in Latin - is **à é i
í** respectively.

There are five **simple tenses**: present, imperfect, future,
conditional, and preterite; and five corresponding **compound tenses**:
perfect, pluperfect, future perfect, conditional perfect, and second
pluperfect. There are three **moods**: indicative, subjunctive, and
imperative. Finally, there are two **participles** (present and past), a
**gerund**, and two **infinitives**.

#### Personal endings

The verbal forms are expressed by adding personal endings to one of the
two **verbal stems**: present and preterite. Six sets of personal
endings cover all possibilities for the inflections of any verb in LN.
LF requires three, which are less distinct than in LN, and subject
pronouns are always used before the verb. In LN, subject pronouns are
only used for emphasis. The personal endings are as follows.

LN

The **-ch-** in the LF second person plural is probably a borrowing from
Brithenig, motivated by the similarity in sound of slender TH and CH.

One verb from each declension is conjugated below; the verbs are
**amháir** “to love”, **fidhéir** \[**fír**\] “to see”, **mitir** “to
send” and **óidhír** “to hear”. The third conjugation is identical to
the fourth, except that the characteristic vowel **-i-** is always short
and thus pronounced as schwa.

#### Infinitive and imperative

The infinitive of all regular verbs ends in **-àir** (first
conjugation), **-éir** (second), **-ir** (third) or **-ír** (fourth).
Removing these endings yields the **present stem** of the verb; thus
**amhàir** for “to love” has the present stem **amh-** \[**cad-**\].

The imperative, the mood of command, has only the present tense; in the
familiar singular it is formed from the bare stem: **amh!** “love!”. In
the plural it is the same as the simple present without the final vowel:
**amhamh!** “let us love!”, **amhaith** “love!” (plural, or polite
singular).

#### Present tense

The commonest tense is of course the present indicative, which
corresponds to “I sing/am singing”, and so on. It is formed with the
present stem plus set 1 of the personal endings; thus in LN:

  -------- ---------- ----------- ---------- -----------
  1 sing   amha       fidhe       mite       óidhe
  2 sing   amhas      fidhis      mitis      óidhis
  3 sing   amhath     fidhith     mitith     óidhith
  1 plur   amhámha    fidhéamha   miteamha   óidhíomha
  2 plur   amháithe   fidhéithe   mitithe    óidhíthe
  3 plur   amhann     fidheann    miteann    óidheann
  -------- ---------- ----------- ---------- -----------

And in LF:

  ------------- ---------------- ------------- ------------ -------------
  1 sing        geo amha         fhidhe        mhite        óidhe
  2 sing        tu amha          fhidhe        mhite        óidhe
  3 sing masc   is amh           fidh          mit          óidh
  3 sing fem    sa amh           fhidh         mhit         óidh
  1 plur        nua h-amhamha    \*fidheamha   \*miteamha   h-óidheamha
  2 plur        fua h-amhaiche   \*fidhiche    \*mitiche    h-óidhiche
  3 plur masc   ise chadann      fhidheann     mhiteann     dhoirmheann
  3 plur fem    saoi chadann     fhidheann     mhiteann     dhoirmheann
  ------------- ---------------- ------------- ------------ -------------

Note the mutations after the pronouns in LF, in particular the
non-mutation after **nua** and **fua**. The final schwa in these persons
is not often pronounced.

Occasionally, in some third conjugation verbs, the final consonant of
the root is broad in the first person singular and third person plural:
**miota, miotann** for **mite, miteann**, but this usage is nowadays not
found outside formal LN.

#### Imperfect tense

The imperfect tense corresponds more or less to English “I was singing”
and “I used to sing”; it is used to express an action which happened
many times, or as the background to another action. It is formed in LN
from the present stem plus the thematic vowel, broad BH and set 2; and
in LF from just the present stem plus set 2:

LN

LF

1 sing

amhàbha

geo chadò

2 sing

tu chadò

3 sing masc

amhàbhath

is cadòth

3 sing fem

ise chadònn

3 plur fem

amhàbhann

saoi chadònn

 

fidhiabha

geo fhidheò

miteabha

geo mhiteò

óidhiabha

geo óidhreò

Note that there is no syncope in the imperfect, i.e you don’t find
**\*amhábhmha**, for example. Note too that the thematic vowels of
conjugations 2 and 4 become IA in LN.

#### Future tense

The future tense - “I will sing” - has two forms. The first, which is
rarely found outside literature and is not used in LF, adds the set 3
endings for the second conjugation to a slightly changed form of the
infinitive, with **-bh-** between except in the first and second persons
plural; the second form adds the same endings in LN and a special set in
LF but syncopates the infinitive and omits the **-bh-**. Here are the
complete future forms of **amhàir** and the first person singulars of
the other sample verbs:

fidhéirbhe

fidhre

fidhre

mitirbhe

mitre

mitre

óidhírbhe

óidhre

óidhre

Note the shortening of the vowel in the 1 and 2 plural in LF. A schwa is
sometimes inserted to break up complicated consonant clusters, as with
**doirmh-i-rbheann** “they will sleep”.

In LF, for the more immediate future the present tense of **féir** (LN
**fàidhir**) “to go” is used with the infinitive: **geo fhéithe amhair**
“I am going to sing”.

#### Conditional tense

The conditional - “I would sing” - is formed by adding the imperfect
endings (BH + set 2) to a more regular form of the syncopated (second)
future. As its name suggests, it is mainly used in conditional
sentences; for example, “if you were here you would see her” is **si tu
ích iarras, tu eall fhidhreós**.

#### Present participle and gerund

These are the only other verb forms which are formed from the present
tense; they correspond roughly to “loving”, “seeing”, “hearing” and so
on. They are formed by substituting **-nte** \[**-de**\] and **-nn** for
the final **-r** of the infinitive; **amhàir** thus has the present
participle **amhàinte** \[**amhàide**\] and the gerund **amhàinn**
\[**amhàinn**\]. The present participle is used as an adjective: **eall
phaoll dhoirmhinte** “the sleeping girl”. The gerund is a noun: **ill
cantàinn dealla phaoll eist bon** “the girl’s singing is good”.

The present participle can also be used with the auxiliary verb
**stàir** “to stand” to make the progressive meaning as in English,
although this is rare: **eall phaoll stath óidhínte** “the girl is
hearing”. In sentences such as “I like singing”, where English has the
present participle as the object of a verb, Breathanach uses the
infinitive: **geo amha cantàir**.

#### The preterite tense

This corresponds to the tense known in Brithenig as the “past definite”
and in French as the “passé simple”; it is used to speak of events which
happened once at a specific time, as in English “I loved”, “I saw”, “I
sent”, “I heard”. It is formed with the past stem and the endings with
long Í, which are set 4 in LN and set 3 in LF.

The past stem of almost all first and fourth conjugations is the same as
the present stem. In the first conjugation, a glide letter A is inserted
before the endings, except in the third person plural where the initial
glide E is not necessary. The past stems of most second and third
conjugation verbs are not always predictable from the present and have
to be learned separately, although the past stems of many third
conjugation verbs are formed with S or T. Thus, omitting the personal
pronouns in LF, the preterites of **amhàir**, **óidhír**, **moinéir**
“to remind” and **scríbhir** “to write” are:

  -------- ----------- ------------ ----------- -------------
  1 sing   amhaí       óidhí        munuí       scrisí
  2 sing   amhaíste    óidhíste     munuíste    scrisíste
  3 sing   amhaíth     óidhíth      munuíth     scrisíth
  1 plur   amhaíomha   óidhíomha    munuíomha   scrisíomha
  2 plur   amhaíst     óidhíst      munuíst     scrisíst
  3 plur   amharann    óidhearann   munarann    scrisearann
  -------- ----------- ------------ ----------- -------------

Note the choice of U as the glide in **munuí**, and many other second
conjugation verbs; this has no effect on the pronunciation and is merely
used to indicate the conjugation.

The LF second person plural forms in **-che** (e.g. **amhaíche**) must
be regarded as non-standard.

#### Past participle

This is usually formed by adding **-th**, or sometimes **-cht** or
**-st** to the past stem, often with changes of vowel in the feminine
singular in LN; thus **amhàtha** “sung”, **óidhíoth/óidhéath** “slept”,
**munúth/munóth** “reminded”, **scríocht/scréacht** ”written”.

#### Subjunctives

The present subjunctive is formed with the present stem and the endings
of set 5 (in LN) or set 1 (in LF). Additionally, the final consonant
changes from broad to slender in the first conjugation and from slender
to broad in the others, often with a change in the stem vowel. Here are
the LN subjunctives of the sample verbs; the LF forms are the same with
short vowels in the endings:

  -------- ----------- ------------- ----------- ------------
  1 sing   aimhe       feidhe        meata       óidhe
  2 sing   aimhis      feidheas      meatas      óidheas
  3 sing   aimhith     feidheath     meatath     óidheath
  1 plur   aimhéamha   feidheámha    meatamha    óidheámha
  2 plur   aimhéithe   feidheáithe   meataithe   óidheáithe
  3 plur   aimhinn     feidheann     meatann     óidheann
  -------- ----------- ------------- ----------- ------------

The imperfect subjunctive, which is very rare in LF, is formed by adding
the thematic vowel, **-(i)s-**, and the set 3 endings to the preterite
stem; thus the 1st person singular imperfect subjunctive of **amhàir**
is **amhàise**.

#### Irregular verbs

Some common verbs are irregular in tenses other than the past. The
following are the three most important.

               “to be”            “to have”           “to go”
  ------------ ------------------ ------------------- ---------------------------
  Infinitive   éiséir             aibhéir             fàidhir \[féir\]

  2 sing       seis               aibhis \[aibhe\]    fàidhis \[féithe\]

  past part    stàth              óth/uath            íoth/éath

#### Compound tenses

Several compound tenses are formed with the various tenses of
**aibhéir** and **éiséir**. Those with **aibhéir** are the various
perfect tenses of transitive verbs (those verbs which take an object):

-   **aibhe amhàth** “I have sung” - present perfect
-   **obhuí amhàth** “I had sung” - pluperfect
-   **aibheabha amhàth** - another pluperfect with the same meaning
-   **aibhre amhàth** “I will have sung” - future perfect
-   **aibhreabha amhàth** “I would have sung” - conditional perfect

Compound tenses with **éiséir** are of two kinds: passive tenses and the
compound perfect tenses of intransitive verbs. In both of these a plural
subject requires a plural form of the past participle, as in the last
example below.

-   **so fíodhúth** “I am seen” - present passive
-   **earra fíodhúth** “I was seen” - past passive
-   **obhuí stàtha fíodhúth** “I have been seen” - present perfect
    passive
-   **so íoth** “I have gone”
-   **sunn càithe** “they have fallen”.

#### LN passives

LN retains an older form of the passive voice in which the forms of
**éiséir** fused with the past participle. Here are the present
indicative passive forms of **amhàir**, **óidhír** and **scribhir**;
note the set 6 endings:

  -------- ----------- ------------- ---------------
  1 sing   amhàsa      óidhíosa      scriochtsa
  2 sing   amhàis      óidhís        scriochtais
  3 sing   amhàst      óidhíst       scriochtaist
  1 plur   amhàsumha   óidhíosumha   scriochtsumha
  2 plur   amhàiste    óidhíste      scriochtaiste
  3 plur   amhàsunn    óidhíosunn    scriochsunn
  -------- ----------- ------------- ---------------

And here are the first person passive forms of the other tenses of
**amhàir**:

  Tense            Form            Endings
  ---------------- --------------- ---------
  Imperfect ind    amhàrra         set 2
  Future           amhàisirbha     set 3
  Conditional      amhàistreabha   set 2
  Preterite        amhàbhuí        set 4
  Present subj     amhàise         set 5
  Imperfect subj   amhàibhise      set 3
  Infinitive       amhàisir        

Past participles of transitive verbs also fused with **éiséir** in this
way to form a synthetic perfect tense: **íosa** “I have gone”.

#### Preverbal particles

Negation is expressed with **no-n** before the verb: **no-namha**
\[**geo no-chada**\] “I do not sing”.

### Conjunctions and relatives {#g-conj}

“That” is expressed by **ca-n**, as in **créidhe ca n-is chantath bein**
“I think that he sings well”. This word is also used for the relative
object pronoun “whom, which”: **eall phaoll ca ngeo fídhí eist beall**
“the girl whom I saw is beautiful”.

The relative subject pronoun “who, which” is **caoi-\***: **eall phaoll
caoi \*me fhídhíth eist beall** “the girl who saw me is beautiful”. In
older forms of the language this caused lenition.

“And” and “or” are **eith** and **oth** in LN, but commonly **e** and
**o** in LF.

Question words {#g-quest}
--------------

Simple questions are normally formed by inverting the subject and
object: **cant(ath) eall phaoll?** “is the girl singing?” If no subject
is present, mere tone of voice suffices: **canta(s)?** “are you
singing?”

The interrogative pronoun “who?” is the same as the corresponding
relatives: **caoi fídhíth me?** “who saw me?”. Its accusative,
corresponding to English “whom”, is the same with eclipsis: **caoi
bhfídhí** “whom did I see?”

Other common question words are:

  --------- --------------
  coil      what kind of
  conn      how much
  coth      which one
  comhodh   how
  uibh      where
  --------- --------------

Numbers {#numb}
-------

The numbers up to twenty are as follows:

  ---- ------------------------ ---- --------------------
  1    ú-n (masc), ún-h (fem)   11   úinde
  2    dua-h                    12   doide, duaide
  3    tria-\*                  13   treide
  4    cotar                    14   cotairde
  5    caonc \[caog\]           15   caínde
  6    seisc                    16   séide, deich-seisc
  7    seicht-n                 17   deich-seicht-n
  8    oicht-n                  18   deich-oicht-n
  9    noibh-n                  19   deich-noibh-n
  10   deich-n                  20   fíghinn \[fínn\]
  ---- ------------------------ ---- --------------------

For example: **seicht gcaine** “seven dogs”, **dua phaolla** “two
girls”, **deich-oicht gcasa** “eighteen houses”. The noun being counted
is often also found in the singular, for example **seicht gcain**.
**ún** is accented when it means specifically “one”, by contrast with
**un** which merely means “a”. The higher numbers are formed in two
ways: with the old Celtic system using twenties, or the Latinate system
with tens. Thus:

         Celtic              Latinate
  ------ ------------------- -------------------------------------
  21     fíghinn e ún        (same)
  22     fíghinn dhua        (same)
  23     fíghinn thria       (same)
  30     fíghinn dheich      tríghinn \[trínn\]
  31     fíghinn úinde       tríghinn e ún
  32     fíghinn dhoide      tríghinn dhua
  40     dua fhíghinn        codhraíghinn \[codhraínn\]
  41     dua fhíghinn e ún   codhraíghinn e ún
  50     dua fhíghinn        dheich cioncaíghinn \[ciogaínn\]
  60     tria fhíghinn       seascaíghinn \[seascaínn\]
  70     tria fhíghinn       dheich seachtaíghinn \[seachtaínn\]
  80     cotar fhíghinn      ochtaíghinn \[ochtaínn\]
  90     cotar fhíghinn      dheich nónaíghinn \[nónaínn\]
  100    ceann               (same)
  1000   mill                (same)

Note that **fíghinn**, **tríghinn** and so on lenite the first letter of
the following word only if it is a number.

“First”, “second” and “third” are **príomh, seacúnn \[scunn\], tirt**.
The higher ordinals are formed by adding **-eamh**: **coitreamh**,
**caoinceamh \[caogeamh\]**, and so on.

This is given here in two versions. First of all, here’s the LN version:

1.  Eith ill mund tóth ún liong eith un uaràith gcomúin obhuíth.

The evolution of Breathanach {#evolution}
----------------------------

Aideicht proisceamh: 23 Iúil 2004

Last update: 23 July 2004

This describes the evolution of my constructed language Breathanach.
Occasionally it will be out of step with the main Breathanach page; if
in doubt as to which is more recent, consult the “Last Update” dates.

### Introduction

Breathanach is derived from a variety of Latin closely related to the
Vulgar Latin from which the other Romance languages developed, with the
principal difference that the distinctions between long and short vowels
were retained.

### Vowels {#vowels}

Consonantal /i u/ are treated as consonants, and in this document are
spelled J W respectively. In general, final syllables were lost entirely
unless they contained a long vowel, in which case they remain as schwa:
**canis** &gt; **cain**, **canes** &gt; **caine**.

#### Short stressed vowels

  Latin   Breathanach   Environment   example
  ------- ------------- ------------- -----------------------
  i       e             before a, o   piscare &gt; peascáir
          i             otherwise     minus &gt; mion
  e       i             before j      
          e             otherwise     ventu &gt; feann
  a       e             before j      abjes &gt; eibh
          o             before w      aqua &gt; oc
          a             otherwise     canis &gt; cain
  o       u             before w      potui &gt; puthuí
          o             otherwise     novus &gt; nobh
  u       o             before a, o   unda &gt; ond
          u             otherwise     ulmus &gt; ulmh

#### Long vowels and diphthongs

  oe      e, i (AO)     always                    poena &gt; paon

\

#### Unstressed vowels

*All* unstressed short vowels are reduced indiscriminately to schwa.

### Consonants {#consonants}

Consonants developed in approximately the following order.

-   H disappears in all cases: **hodje** &gt; **oidh**, **Johanne** &gt;
    **Eóinn**.
-   Q becomes C.
-   V becomes F initially, B (later BH) intervocalically, and W
    otherwise: **vesper** &gt; **feisbir**, **levis** &gt; **léibh**. W
    becomes B after L R: **parwus** &gt; **parbh**.
-   J becomes G (later GH) intervocalically: **pejore** &gt; **pighir**.
-   J becomes G initially before a back vowel: **Iulius** &gt;
    **Giúil**.
-   MN, GN and final NT become NN: **pugnu** &gt; **punn**,
    **ventu** &gt; **feann**.
-   NS, PS and SS all become single S, lengthening the preceding vowel:
    **pensare** &gt; **piasáir**, **capsa** &gt; **cás**.
-   X becomes SC: **nux** &gt; **nusc**.
-   MPT and NCT become NT.
-   /pt kt/ both become CHT: **ruptu** &gt; **rucht**, **lacte** &gt;
    **laicht**.
-   Consonants preceding E I J becone slender.
-   P T C B D G M all lenite between vowels, between a vowel and L R,
    and finally after a vowel or L R; but note that T D are not lenited
    after L R.
-   Double consonants are reduced to single: **mittere** &gt; **mitir**.

#### LF developments from LN

-   PH TH CH BH DH GH before L R disappear and lengthen the preceding
    vowel, changing the L R to LL RR: **nigru** &gt; **nioghr** &gt; LF
    **níorr**.
-   MP NT NC become simple B D G: **rumpere** &gt; **ruibir**,
    **cantare** &gt; **cadáir**, **ancilla** &gt; **aigeall**.
-   MB ND NG become M N NG: **impoisibh** &gt; **iboisibh**. NG in LF
    sounds as in “siNG”.
-   ABH OBH UBH finally or before a short vowel become Ó Ú Ú, with TH
    added finally to nouns: **cantabha** &gt; **cantó**, **nobh** &gt;
    **núth**.
-   AIDH EIDH IDH and AIGH EIGH IGH similarly become É Í Í:
    **gleidh** &gt; **glíth**.
-   In the preceding nine groups, if the preceding vowel is long the
    consonant disappears, although it is still written TH finally on
    nouns: **fáigh** &gt; **féith**.
-   Intervocalic TH is lost before a short vowel, lengthening the
    preceding vowel: **béathal** &gt; **béal**.

### Relative chronology

Or, put another way, what order the changes took place in. The “stages”
are purely arbitrary; a “sonant” is a vowel or /l r/.

#### Stage 1

-   Loss of /h/. Between vowels, the preceding vowel is lengthened and
    the following vowel lost.
-   /q/ &gt; /c/
-   /v/ &gt; /f/ initially, /u/ otherwise
-   /u/ &gt; /b/ between /l r/ and a vowel
-   /e i/ &gt; /g'/ between vowels and initially before /a o u/
-   /u i e/ &gt; /w j j/ between a consonant and a vowel
-   /e i/ &gt; /j/ initially before a vowel
-   /ie/ &gt; /e/ initially

#### Stage 2

-   /au/ &gt; /o:/
-   /ae oe/ &gt; /e:/ (written AO)
-   /w/ &gt; /b/ after /l r/
-   /mn gn/ &gt; /nn/
-   /nt/ &gt; /nn/ before a vowel
-   /ns ps/ &gt; /s/, lengthening the preceding vowel
-   /ks/ (X) &gt; /sk/
-   /mpt nkt/ &gt; /nt/
-   /pt kt/ &gt; /xt/ (CHT)

#### Stage 3

-   All consonants become slender before /e i j/ and finally after /e
    i/, and broad otherwise
-   short /a e/ &gt; /e i/ before /j/
-   short /a o/ &gt; /o u/ before /w/
-   /e i o u/ &gt; /E e O o/ before /a o/, whether long or short

#### Stage 4

-   /E:/ &gt; /ia/ in first syllable before a broad consonant
-   /O:/ &gt; /ua/ in first syllable except before /k g/
-   /E O/ &gt; /e o/, long or short
-   /ja wa we/ &gt; /e o e/ before a consonant

#### Stage 5

-   /p t k b d g m/ lenite between a sonant and a vowel, or finally
    after a sonant
-   /p k b g m/ lenite between vowels, or finally after a vowel
-   All geminate consonants other than /n l r/ become single
-   Geminate /l n r/ and initial /n l r/ delenite
-   Final short vowels dissapear
-   Short vowels in non-initial syllables become schwa
-   Long vowels in non-initial syllables shorten
