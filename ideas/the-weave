<div class="entry-content"><p>Once upon a time, I was a relatively active <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language">conlanger</a>, and was active in the conculture community, particularly the <a href="http://ib.frath.net/w/Ill_Bethisad">Ill Bethisad</a> shared universe, and had some of my&nbsp;own.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to get back into all that, and I&#8217;m currently working on resurrecting all my old work. I&#8217;ve a lot to dig out, and I&#8217;m not doing it in any particular&nbsp;order.</p>
<h2>The&nbsp;Weave</h2>
<p>Back when I was a teenager, I got involved in <a href="http://conlang.org/">constructed languages</a>. I&#8217;m not sure exactly <em>how</em> it happened that I started fiddling around with a constructed language, but what I do remember is that it came out an idea I had in my head for a story, or rather a universe to set the story in, and key to that was something I called <em>The Weave</em>.</p>
<p>The Weave refers to a quasi-metaphysical construct common to worlds within the metaseries. Like how cloth is woven, The Weave consists of ordinary people, <em>the Warp</em> who are capable of true free will, and <em>the Weft</em>, souls whose purpose is to hold the Weave together, recurring in different bodies over time. While they are conscious beings with free will, their actions are constrained because they partially experience the flow of time backwards, thus making them predestined to act to preserve the Weave. As such, those who are part of the Weft can be thought of as liminal beings; the actions of the Weft sometimes the stuff of legends, but often seemingly mundane, but with important rippling effects on the greater world. But at it&#8217;s core were the resolution of the conflict between free will and pre-destination, as well as the the heroism of small&nbsp;actions.</p>
<p>I was stopped in my tracks when I heard about Michael Moorcock&#8217;s <em>Eternal Champion</em> series, which was, in my estimation too close to the ideas I had for the Weave. Like Eretas and <a href="https://i.canthack.it/pages/porteressia.html">the Porteressia</a>, which are loosely connected to The Weave, I may restart work on this some&nbsp;day.</p>
