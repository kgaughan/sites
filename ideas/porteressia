		<h1>The Porteressia</h1>

	<p>The Porteressia (meaning, &#8216;The People of Portu&#8217;) was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_culture">conculture</a> I worked on some years back. It&#8217;s far from finished, but I figure I ought to put my notes up online.</p>

<p>The language and culture were developed for a set of stories I&#8217;d intended to write revolving initially about a messiah-like figure called <em>Portu</em> and later on the effect he had on the culture he was part of. The stories were intended to be part of a metaseries centring on something called <em><a href="the-weave">The Weave</a></em>, and was meant to deal with themes like the resolution of the ideas of pre-destination and free will, the heroism of small actions, and other such lofty things.</p>

<p><img src="http://stereochro.me/assets/uploads/concultures/eretas_e1.png" width="50" height="139" title="The word 'eretas', meaning 'language'" style="float:right">I got as far as developing a complete <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system">writing system</a> called <em>Fenaï[^dieresis]</em>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Featural_alphabet">featural alphabet</a> (albeit with some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad">abjad</a>-like properties), and one (decorative) typeface. I&#8217;ve included a same of the word &#8216;Eretas&#8217;, which means &#8216;speech&#8217; or &#8216;language&#8217;, to give you an idea of what text written in the language would look like. It runs from top to bottom, left-to-right. The character shapes take influence from the <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/writing/syriac.htm">syriac Nestorian script</a> and the <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/writing/manchu.htm">Manchu alphabet</a>, so much so that the <a href="http://home.ccil.org/~cowan/essential.html">essentialist explanation</a> I came up with for <em>Fenaï</em> is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fenaïr[^articles] is essentially badly scrawled Nestorian masquerading as Manchu.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Feel free to download <a href="http://stereochro.me/assets/uploads/concultures/eretas.pdf">my unfinished notes on Eretas</a> in PDF form. Some day, I&#8217;d like to revisit Eretas and the Porteressia when I&#8217;ve time and some inspiration.</p>

<p>For a rough idea of what the language looks like, here&#8217;s a slightly updated version of the CONLANG t-shirt fragment, which translates as &#8220;Fight language death: invent a language&#8221;: <em>Mjulhin eretasséan sjessonde; eretas ellonde</em>. I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s out of date though. Here&#8217;s the interlinear:</p>

<table class="interlinear" style="margin:1em auto 1em auto">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Mjulhin</td>
      <td>eretasséan</td>
      <td>sjessonde;</td>
      <td>eretas</td>
      <td>ellonde</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>death</td>
      <td>language.GENpl</td>
      <td>dispute.IMPpl</td>
      <td>language</td>
      <td>make.IMPpl</td>
    </td>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>[^dieresis]: That dieresis is a hint that &#8216;ai&#8217; is not a diphthong, but two separately pronounced vowels.</p>

<p>[^articles]: Articles are enclitic, as in languages such as Danish. The article <em>ir</em> (&#8216;that&#8217;) becomes &#8216;-r&#8217; and is attached to the end of the word. Thus <em>fenaï</em> means &#8216;strokes&#8217; whereas <em>fenaïr</em> means &#8216;the strokes&#8217;. Similarly, the singular would be <em>fene</em>, &#8216;stroke&#8217;, and <em>fener</em>, &#8216;the stroke&#8217;.</p>
