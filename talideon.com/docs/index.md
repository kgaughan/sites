# Talideon.com

_talideon.com_ is the online home of [Keith Gaughan](https://keith.gaughan.ie/about/), a software developer based in Dublin in Ireland.

[I have a weblog](https://keith.gaughan.ie/) where I write about random things occasionally.
I also have a linklog called [Inklings](https://talideon.com/inklings/) where I post links to things I stumble across.

I'm on [Github](https://github.com/kgaughan) and I'm also on the [SDF Mastodon instance](https://mastodon.sdf.org/) as [@talideon](https://mastodon.sdf.org/@talideon/).
I used to be on Twitter as [@talideon](https://twitter.com/talideon), though [I've stopped using it](https://keith.gaughan.ie/leaving-twitter.html).
Apparently things got worse after I left.
I sometimes answer coding questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/8342/keith-gaughan), and have the obligatory [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keithgaughan) account I only look at once in a blue moon.

# Useful sites

A collection of sites I occasionally visit.
If you want a list of stuff as I stumble across it, see my tumblog, [Inklings](https://talideon.com/inklings/).
It uses [Komorebi](https://github.com/kgaughan/komorebi), a small tumblog engine.
