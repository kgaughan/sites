I blog at [Can't Hack](https://i.canthack.it/) and  have a linklog called [Inklings](https://talideon.com/inklings/).

I'm also on Twitter as [@talideon](https://twitter.com/talideon), and on [Github](https://github.com/kgaughan). I sometimes answer coding questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/8342/keith-gaughan), and have the obligatory [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keithgaughan) account.
