# Talideon.com

_talideon.com_ is the online home of [Keith Gaughan](https://keith.gaughan.ie/about/), a software developer based in Ireland.

[I have a weblog](https://keith.gaughan.ie/) where I write about random things occasionally.
I also have a linklog called [Inklings](https://talideon.com/inklings/) where I post links to things I stumble across.
It uses a small webapp I knocked together called [Komorebi](https://github.com/kgaughan/komorebi).

I'm also on Twitter as [@talideon](https://twitter.com/talideon), though [I've stopped using it](https://keith.gaughan.ie/leaving-twitter.html), and on [Github](https://github.com/kgaughan).
I sometimes answer coding questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/8342/keith-gaughan), and have the obligatory [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keithgaughan) account.

I have a [page of useful sites](sites.md) that I visit semi-regularly.
