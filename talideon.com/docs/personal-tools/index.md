# Personal tools

This page is here to fulfil a requirement of Google for OAuth access to Google
Drive amongst other things.

Unfortunately, there seems to be no way to generate client ID/secret pairs that
can only be used with _one_ account for personal use, thus this rigmarole.

So, Keith, even though you're only using this for your own personal projects,
do you promise not to hack your own Gibson and do nasty things with your own
data?
