# Ohai!

This is my first test of tilde.club.

I'm nobody particulary special, but you can find me elsewhere on the internet while I figure out what to do with my tildespace:

* I'm [@talideon](https://twitter.com/talideon) on Twitter.
* I've a poorly-maintained blog called [Can't Hack It](https://i.canthack.it/).
* [I'm also on Github](https://github.com/kgaughan/).

Any other mentions of 'talideon' online are almost certainly me, or somebody masquerading as me.

## What will I be doing here?

I don't know yet. I'm using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) as a site generator for now, but part of me thinks I should switch to using plain old HTML, possibly even the HTML 2 (with supplements) subset of HTML 5, CSS 1, and SSI for that genuine late-'90s feel!
