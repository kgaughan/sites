==================
My tilde.club site
==================

This is deployed at https://tilde.club/~talideon/

I have no idea what I'm going to do with it. It'll probably end up being
rather tilde-centric. Or just decay due to bitrot. I'm mainly doing this out
of nostalgia.

This site needs mkdocs__ to build and rsync to deploy it.
